# Tasks

0. a + b

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: def add(a, b):
Returns the value of a + b
You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand **import**

1. a ^ b

Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

Prototype: def pow(a, b):
Returns the value of a ^ b
You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand **import**

2. Temperature Converter Function

Write a Python function called convert_to_celsius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius.

Prototype: def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit)
Returns the temperature in Celsius
You are not allowed to import any module.

3. String Manipulation Function

Write a Python function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

Prototype: def reverse_string(string)
Returns the reversed string.
You are not allowed to import any module.

4. Fibonacci Sequence Function

Write a Python function called fibonacci_sequence that takes a number n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.

Prototype: def fibonacci_sequence(n)
Returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
You are not allowed to import any module.
Return an empty list if the it is not possible to generate the Fibonacci numbers for n

5. Prime Number Function

Write a Python function called is_prime that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

Prototype: def is_prime(number)
Returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.
You are not allowed to import any module.
You don’t need to understand **import**

6. Password Validation Function

Write a Python function called validate_password that takes a password as input and performs the following checks:

The password should be at least 8 characters long.
The password should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
The password should not contain spaces.

Prototype: def validate_password(password)

Returns True if the password passes all the checks, and False otherwise.

You are not allowed to import any module.

You don’t need to understand **import**

# Evaluation Quiz

0. What is the Zen of Python?

A philosophy guiding the design of Python

1. What is the purpose of the import statement in Python?

It allows you to include external libraries or modules in your code.

2. How do you use conditional statements (if, elif, else) in Python?

if statements are used for executing a block of code only if a certain condition is true.
elif statements are used to specify an alternative condition if the preceding if or elif condition is false.
else statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed if none of the preceding conditions are true.

3. How do you pass arguments to a function in Python?

By enclosing the arguments in parentheses after the function name.

4. How do you use else clauses on loops in Python?

The else clause is executed if the loop terminates normally (without encountering a break statement).

5. How do you print text and variables using print?

print("Hello", name)

6. Why is indentation so important in Python?

It improves code readability
It affects the program's logic and structure
It is required by the Python interpreter

7. What does a traceback in Python refer to?

A message indicating the source of an error or exception

8. How do you use the if statement in Python?

if x == 5:

9. What does a function return if it does not use any return statement?

None

10. What does the pass statement do, and when should you use it?

It is a placeholder statement that does nothing and is used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

11. How do you use the break statement in Python?

It exits the current loop and resumes program execution at the next statement.

12. What are indexing and slicing in Python?

Ways to access and manipulate elements in a sequence

13. What is a function in Python, and how do you use functions?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be reused by calling its name.

14. Why is Python programming considered awesome?

It is easy to learn and read
It is widely used in the industry
It has a large and active community

15. How do you use the range function in Python?

range(5, 10, 2) returns the sequence 5, 7, 9
range(10) returns the sequence 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
range(1, 5) returns the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4

18. Who created Python?

Guido van Rossum

19. What does the len() function in Python return?

The total number of elements in a list or string.

20. What is the scope of variables in Python?

Variables in Python can have either local or global scope depending on their declaration.
