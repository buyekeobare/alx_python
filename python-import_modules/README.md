# Tasks

0. Import a simple function from a simple file

Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
You are not allowed to use \* for importing or **import**
Your code should not be executed when imported - by using **import**, like the example below

1. How to make a script dynamic!

Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:
Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
one line per argument:
the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line
Your code should not be executed when imported
The number of elements of argv can be retrieved by using: len(argv)
You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a collection of arguments: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.

2. Everything can be imported

Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_2.py and prints its value.

You are not allowed to use \* for importing or **import**
Your code should not be executed when imported

3. Integers division with debug

Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.

Prototype: def safe_print_division(a, b):
You can assume that a and b are integers
The result of the division should print on the finally: section preceded by Inside result:
Returns the value of the division, otherwise: None
You have to use try: / except: / finally:
You have to use "{}".format() to print the result
You are not allowed to import any module

4. Raise exception

Write a function that raises a type exception.

Prototype: def raise_exception():
You are not allowed to import any module

5. Raise a message

Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.

Prototype: def raise_exception_msg(message=""):
You are not allowed to import any module

# Evaluation Quiz

0. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function(counter):
> > > print("Counter: {}".format(counter))
> > >
> > > my_function(12)

Counter: 12

1. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function(counter=89):
> > > return counter + 1
> > >
> > > print(my_function())

90

2. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function():
> > > print("In my function")
> > >
> > > my_function()

In my function

3. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function(counter=89):
> > > print("Counter: {}".format(counter))
> > >
> > > my_function(12)

Counter: 12

4. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function():
> > > print("In my function")
> > >
> > > my_function

function my_function at …

5. What do these lines print?

> > > def my_function(counter=89):
> > > print("Counter: {}".format(counter))
